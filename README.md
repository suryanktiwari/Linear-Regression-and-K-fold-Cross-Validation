Implementation of Linear Regression and K fold cross validation in python from scratch on Boston Housing Dataset.

* Performed Linear Regression on all features and computed the RMSE for training and testing set.
* From the feature LSTAT, the feature MEDV was predicted with varying degrees of polynomial fits.
* RMSE for various degrees computed with k fold cross validation.
* Visualization of graphs for data points vs the polynomials observed.
